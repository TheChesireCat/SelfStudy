    What Are Complex Systems? [1.1 p3]

    Complex systems are networks made of a **number of components** that interact with each other, typically in a **nonlinear** fashion. Complex systems may arise and evolve through **self-organization**, such that they are neither completely regular nor completely random, permitting the development of **emergent behavior at macroscopic scales**
