USEFUL GIFT

A useful new year present.

—Times of India, Bombay.

The publication of this book, written with the object of helping foreign tourists to Tamilnad who cannot engage a teacher during their short stay is timely.

The approach of the author to the teaching of a language which is distinct from other Indian Languages in that there is no alphabet in Tamil to represent phonetic sounds, for example Kanthi and Gandhi, are written in the same way but pronounced differently, is laudable.

The book contains a vocabulary which is essential for daily use and some sentences that are used in daily conver- sation. Considering the limited objective, the publication can be commended.

GREAT SERVICE TO
TAMIL LANGUAGE

I have gone through the book “Learn Tamil in thirty days” with great interest. The Publishers have done great service to the Tamil language by bringing out the book which is the need of the hour. Tamil is probably the oldest language in the world. It is a well developed and sweet language. The Author has found out the right way of teaching this wonderful language in this simple a way as possible. I congratulate the author and the Publishers for their service to the Tamil language.
