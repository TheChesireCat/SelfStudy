“This is the book I want”

—Dr. Zakir Hussain
(Late) President of India

An avowed admirer of Tamils and their Culture, President Zakir Hussain is holding our book ‘‘LEARN TAMIL IN 30 DAYS’’ in his hand.

After declaring open the hostel for legislators at the Government Estate in Madras on 5th January 1968, the Pre- sident was going round the building with the Governer of Madras and the Chief Minister C.N.Annadurai. The latter pulled out two copies of our book from a book stall inside the buil- ding and presented them to the Presi- dent and the Governor.

The President smiled and said ‘‘This is really the kind of book I would like to receive’’.
