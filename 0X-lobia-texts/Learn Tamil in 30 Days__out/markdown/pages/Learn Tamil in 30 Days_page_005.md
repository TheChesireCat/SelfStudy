December 4, 1967

Dear Sir,

It is gratifying to learn that Balaji Pub- lications will be bringing out a book entitled, ''Learn Tamil in 30 days'' for the benefit of our honoured Guests from abroad, the stream of Tourists and visitors who will flock in large numbers to the International Trade and Industries Fair at Madras. This thoughtfully envisaged venture of affording a handy medium of becoming conversant with the rudiments of Tamil Language without tears, is indeed com- mendable. I wish your efforts all success.

(Sd.) V. V. GIRI,
Vice-President of India.
