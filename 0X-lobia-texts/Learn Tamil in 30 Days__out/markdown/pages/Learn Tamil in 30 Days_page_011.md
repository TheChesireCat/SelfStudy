vowels, consonants, and special letters. The second part deals with simple words with nouns, verbs, etc. The third part is the most important as it contains every word that a visitor to Tamilnadu should know. The fourth part is about sentences and conversations. The last part contains letters, essays and new words, etc. As there are 247 letters, a new unorthodox method has been adopted. Easy steps are provided with Roman characters for pronunciation. For easy understanding, separate headings have been used.

### Easy way

All letters, words and sentences have been given in the following order with Roman characters below:— first the Tamil words, their pronunciation in Roman characters and their meaning in English at the bottom so that the reader can easily understand. This is the set-up of the book.

There are 12 vowels and 18 consonants in Tamil; 4 consonants are peculiar to Tamil and of these the letter 'zha' may be considered to be the unique feature of Tamil language. Consonants are doubled—when two words are combined.

The reader must be able to know important words and pick up conversation through simple words and sentences. This is the main objective; how far I have succeeded will have to be judged by the readers.
