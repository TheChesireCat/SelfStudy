# Log

Researcher's log. This is a plain text file that contains course material or items related to self study associated with my self exploration. Sometimes this is just me trying to get better at writing. Or exploring ideas or maintaining a log. Feels like I'm a captain on the high seas. Lol.

https://sites.google.com/view/nss-videos - some4 for networks . lets fucking go.
deadline September 30, 2025
 ($500 for 1st place, $300 for 2nd, and $200 for 3rd).
 i have how many days 30-4+1 = 27 days
 hmm this should be short and sweet.


tinas class
matteo class

three birds one stone

(note taking app make maybe?)

1. sdk m50 is done. will push it to dev to check - done
2. doing slw m50 contacts now - done
3. check contacts indices - export to gcp - in progress
4. reading - The Why, How, and When of Representations for Complex Systems


- fall colors - leaf venation network and single leaf color dynamics
- dessication of surfaces and the networks of crack formation

Day: 1 of the PhD

### Themes of The Day:
- Cellular automata and complex systems
- Simple rules → complex behavior
- Automata, networks, and organization
- Research ideas for Complexity 72 (NetSI London)
- Matteo’s revised action items

### Notes / Reflections
- I was thinking about cellular automata in the context of complex systems. Don’t remember which paper/book/podcast, but the idea of simple rules leading to emergent complex behavior still blows my mind.  
- I want to finish Hiroki Sayama’s book, then Newman’s *Networks* book. These will help me explore the problems around automata and complexity.  
- Conference season is near. Complexity 72 is at Northeastern London with NetSI. I’d like to prepare one or two good paper ideas.  
- Brainstorming tracks:  
  **Operational (Epi):**  
  - Networks of contact  
  - Processing shapes of contact and networks  
  - OpenStreetMaps + network layers → hypergraphs?  
  - Commute networks  

  **Fun:**  
  - Automata and complexity of organization  
    - Rule 30,130 / 1D automata as network  
    - R/Place and simplicial complexes of organization  
  - Computation and networks  
    - Turing machine states as network  
    - Tape/program state spaces as networks  
    - Computational puzzles as networks (e.g. [Klotski](https://2swap.github.io/Klotski-Webpage/), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGLNyHd2w10 )  
  - Network of attention in large language models  
    - Sparse neuron state space networks  
    - Pruned networks and their shape  
    - Attention as mappings across dimensional spaces  

### Tasks
- Matteo’s revised action items (priority order):  
  [0] Babysit queries  
  [1] Read for Tina’s class and early chapters of Newman (*Networks*)  
  [2] **Prepare handover of regression forecasting work (hospital forecasting). Need to meet Andy this week and put things in order.** 
  [3] Re-run regression of mobility (SIERRA vs ALL) with full 2022 panels → rebuild indices. Includes dashboard GUI changes. **REBUILD SIERRA INDICES ** 
  [4] Hospital index pipeline (LOW priority). Irene’s responsibility, I only consult if needed.  


**Important**
Metanode definition using only SIERRA
one set of weights for SIERRA
one set of weights for SLW



**Tina Reading** 

1. Collect reading list of CS224W
2. Collect reading list of NETS7332



[0] Babysit queries  
- county indices - running now
- csa - spotted error - running again
- running all 
- RUN SIERRA INDEX NOTEBOOKS

[1] Read for Tina’s class and early chapters of Newman (*Networks*)
- compiled a list for tina's class - papers from previous years
- reading early chapters 
- DIRECTED readings -

- watch https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn ,jure's course, jure leskovec, tina's class is based on this course. so it is imperitive i understand the material here. 


Interesting links of the day :

https://galileo-unbound.blog/2021/06/28/a-random-walk-in-10-dimensions/
https://microsoft.github.io/VibeVoice/ [this can be used for my paper tts thing]


- need to update the sierra nodemap table and the sierra wiehgts table
- run the sierra indices again
